    <p>
        Bears are carnivoran mammals and are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Bears are found on the
        continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large
        bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile
        claws, and short tails.

    <p>
        The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal and it is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
        ruminant on Earth. The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its
        horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands.

    <p>
        The lion is a large cat and native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded
        head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although
        some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively
        seek out and prey on humans.

    <!-- Description of monkeys written below the picture in a smaller font size -->
    <p>
        Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians.
        Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, thus
        monkeys constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes
        are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope.

    <p>
        An alligator, or colloquially gator, is a large reptile in the Crocodilia order in the genus Alligator of the
        family Alligatoridae. The two extant species are the American alligator and the Chinese alligator. The name
        "alligator" is likely an anglicized form of el lagarto, the Spanish term for "the lizard", which early Spanish
        explorers and settlers in Florida called the alligator. Early English spellings of the name included allagarta
        and alagarto.
